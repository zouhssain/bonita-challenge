By default, only the Bonita Admin App is included and you may add/remove other applications using the extensions Marketplace.
createPomMigrationTitle=Create project POM file
createPomMigrationDescription=Introducing Bonita 2021.2, the Bonita project now uses Maven to handle its dependencies.\n\nConnectors, actor filters or any other java library dependencies can now be declared as Maven dependencies.\nCheck the documentation for more information about<a href="727">Project composition</a>.\n\nIn addition, the required Java version is now Java 11.\n\nNOTE: If an existing `pom.xml` was already existing, it has been backup in a `pom.xml.old` file.\nThe `pom.xml` file is reserved for internal use and should not be accessed directly. Use the new Project overview dashboard in the Studio to edit your project.
removeLegacyFolderMigrationTitle=Remove legacy folders from project
removeLegacyFolderMigrationDescription=Remove folders from the project that are no more relevant (eg: feature not supported anymore).\n\nIn the case of connector/actor filter implementations a backup folder is created to avoid data loss.

javaDependenciesMigrationTitle=Java Dependencies update
javaDependenciesMigrationDescription=This step will update your project dependencies from jar files in 'lib' folder into Maven artifact dependencies.\n\nTo do so it will lookup on Maven central for a match between a jar file and an available artifact (using jar file hash). When not found, the jar file will be moved into a '.store' folder using a Maven repository layout and installed into your local Maven repository.\nIt is highly recommended to not rely on this local storage mechanism and make sure that all your external dependencies are published on a Maven repository (public or private).

It is a technical change and will not impact the design usage in Bonita Studio. New Maven modules and their respective 'pom.xml' files are reserved for internal Studio use.\n\nBusiness Data Model is now build in its own Maven submodule.\nWhile it does not impact the design usage, it can now be built and deployed independently from a Studio.\n\nThe BDM model dependency share the same 'version' and 'groupId' of the parent project.

extensionsModuleMigrationTitle=Extensions modules update
extensionsModuleMigrationDescription=Rest API Extensions and Themes projects have been moved in the project layout to benefit from the Maven multi-module layout.\nIt means that files location inside the project have changed. It is a technical change and will not impact the design usage in Bonita Studio. Project's extensions are now build in their own maven module.\nWhile it does not impact the design usage, this internal change allow the usage of a standard Maven build lifecycle.\n\nAll extensions share the same 'version' and 'groupId' of the parent project. It is enforced by the format of the Bonita project and must not be changed.
providedGroovyScriptRemovedMigrationTitle=Remove provided Groovy classes
providedGroovyScriptRemovedMigrationDescription=Deprecated provided Groovy classes `BonitaUsers`, `BonitaSql`, `BonitaXML` and `BonitaTypes` will be removed.\n\nIf not already done, update any Groovy script referencing these classes with alternatives.\n\nYou may use Expression editor's code templates to help you update your scripts.
